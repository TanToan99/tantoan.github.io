                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p><br><br>
                <p>I am interested in the website development position at FPT Company, as advertised on vietnamwork website. I believe that the skills and experiences I have gained at this position make me an ideal candidate for the job of website development.</p>
                <br><p>During my internship in OJT time , I gained hands-on experience coding under the direction of a team, collaborating on software projects, and testing systems and applications. One of my responsibilities was developing creative solutions across a variety of software platforms. Some of my accomplishments include helping to create mobile ready expense tracking software for clients as well as the creation of a new document management system.</p>
                <br><p>I was also instrumental in building and implementing an automated bug tracking system that would spot issues in the development process, ultimately resulting in a 22 percent reduction in issues reported in the later stages of development.</p>
                <br><p>I am confident that my experience in the Legislature and my research and writing skills qualify me for consideration. If you would like, I can provide you with current samples of my work. I have also enclosed my resume. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail.</p>
                <br>
                Sincerely,<br>
                Tan Toan
