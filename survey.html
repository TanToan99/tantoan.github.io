                    <p>In recent years in Vietnam, love relationships have become deadlocked because of the covid epidemic in 
                        the past 2 years, causing many couples to break up because they cannot solve physiological problems. 
                        Therefore, the Friend with benefits (FWB) relationship is of great interest to many people. So we created 
                        the survey as a study designed to learn more about the communication that occurs in the FWB relationship 
                        with Benefits.

                    <div class="text"> The purpose of this study? </div>
                    <p>
                        This form of interpersonal relationship is becoming increasingly popular among people in their early to 
                        mid-20’s but has not yet been thoroughly researched. Thus, this study will begin to look at the 
                        communication that occurs between partners engaging in Friends with Benefits relationships. For this 
                        study, Friends with Benefits Relationships are defined as: A sexual relationship with a friend whom you 
                        are not dating at the time of sexual involvement and do not have any intention of dating. The relationship 
                        lacks commitment, a desire for a romantic relationship, and emotional.</p>

            <div class="skills-content">
                <p>The issue of whether to start a FWB relationship or not depends on each person's views and thoughts. In 
                    the past, many people believed that this relationship went against morality, especially those who were 
                    married, so they were strongly opposed.<br>
                    However, in today's society, in Western countries, this issue has become much more open. Therefore, 
                    this out-of-the-way relationship is still welcomed by many people.<br>
                    Some other young people think that starting a FWB relationship is not advisable. Because this 
                    relationship will not last forever, if it lasts more or less, it will also hurt you. Especially, for those who 
                    have families, what if the other side knows the truth?<br>
                    So, before deciding whether to start a relationship with "no strings attached", please carefully consider 
                    the risks that you may have to bear after ending it!<br>
                    Because an FWB relationship needs the following elements:<br>
                    - Both are mature, financially independent, thinking mature and able to make their own decisions about 
                    their own lives.<br>
                    - They can care for each other but absolutely must not ask for anything from the other in terms of love, 
                    future, marriage.<br>
                    - Willing to share, experience anything about sex in a fun way without feeling uncomfortable.<br>
                    - Ending the relationship FWB still shows respect for each other.<br>
                    Hopefully the survey will help you get a satisfactory answer to the question, what is FWB? Whether to 
                    start a “friends with benefits” relationship or not. If you do the above and are willing to accept it then a 
                    FWB relationship can begin. Because should or not depends on the personal opinion of each person.
